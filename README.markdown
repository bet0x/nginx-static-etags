Nginx Static Etags
------------------

Nginx doesn't generate etags for static content.  I think it should.  If I can remember enough C from college to make it work as a module, I will.

This does not work yet.

It will not work for quite some time, if ever.  But it's a fun way to play a bit with C again.
